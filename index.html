        <p> 
        <strong>Give context</strong> on what you are trying to do, 
        <br>learn how to <strong>describe the problem</strong> for your mentor.
        <br><strong>Outline the things</strong> you have <strong>already tried</strong> to fix the issue.
        <br><strong>Offer your analysis</strong> before asking your mentor. 
        This helps the person who is helping you to not only know what you are thinking 
        but also know that you have done some thinking on your own.
        <br><strong>Demo</strong> what is happening. 
        <br>Include the  <strong>code, a traceback error message, and an explanation</strong> 
        of the steps you executed that resulted in the error.</p>
